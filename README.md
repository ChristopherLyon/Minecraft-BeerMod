## About this mod



The Minecraft-BeerMod aims to bring all the fuctionality expected in brewing beers to Minecraft. The entire scope of production from planting and harvesting, to fermenting, destilling, carbonating and consuming. We hope this mod will be equal parts fun and informative to those interested in the craft of brewing. As this mod is under contruction, dont expect all features to be implemented. We will release `version 1.0.0` when the base mod is ready to be installed.
